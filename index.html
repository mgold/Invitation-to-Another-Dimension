        A linear function for an input (called <span class='x1'>x</span>) <i>scales</i> x by multiplying it by a scale
        factor called m. Then it <i>translates</i> the result by adding another value, called b. The output we call
        <span class='y1'>y</span>.

        You can adjust these values in the equations, in the text below, or on the graph itself directly. Hover over a
        red circle to see the exact value.

          This is the classic linear function from middle school, and it has one input and one output. It's natural to
          ask, what happens if we put two of these functions together? The simplest approach is to have two outputs –
          <span class=y1>y<small>1</small></span> and <span class=y2>y<small>2</small></span> – depend on a single
          input, still called <span class=x1>x</span>. We can double-down on equations, or we can think of these outputs
          as forming a <i>vector</i>.

          The vector equation uses the two fundamental operations of linear algebra: scalar multiplication and vector
          addition.

        This is a scalar field: two inputs going to one output, encoded as the area of circles, either <span
            class=y1>positive</span> or <span class=negative>negative</span>. Bear in mind that this is a sample; the
        true scalar field is a continuous surface "above" and "below" the plane of the screen, tilted flatness
        interrupted by a V-shaped rift. You might see this rift as a "wave" of whiteness moving across the field as you
        change the additive constant (<span class='third param'></span>). It's
        tempting to see the wave moving perpendicular to itself, but this is an
        illusion – it's always moving vertically.

          The vector equation on the right uses the dot product of two vectors to concisely represent the repeated
          multiplication and addition operations on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can ask, what happens when we have two inputs and two outputs? Graphically, the result is a <i>vector field</i>;
          symbolically, we use a <i>matrix</i> to compactly store all the parameters. A matrix is really just a
          function.
