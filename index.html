      <h1>Invitation to Another Dimension</h1>
      <h2>from Max Goldstein</h2>
      <p>
        So much of math seems to be unrelated bits and pieces. Learn this for the test, then forget it to make room for
        the next thing. But this is an illusion fostered by the frequently atrocious high school curriculum. Mathematics
        has structure, ideas that start simple and then are extended and combined. Here, we're looking at two of them:

        <ul>
            <li>Functions transform inputs into outputs. You can group similar functions by how many inputs and outputs
            they take. For our purposes, each input or output is just a number. We'll call the inputs <span
                class='x1'>x</span> and the outputs <span class='y1'>y</span>, adding subscript numbers once we get more
            than one. Each input or output is called a <i>dimension</i>.
            </li>

            <li>We're looking at functions that use addition and multiplication only to turn inputs into outputs. We'll
            see that geometrically, addition is <i>translation</i> and multiplication is <i>scaling</i>. We'll leave the
            polynomials, exponentials, and sine waves for another day.
            </li>
        </ul>

        A linear function for an input, called <span class='x1'>x</span>, will scale the input by multiplying it by a
        scale factor called m. Then it translates the result by adding another value, called b. The output we
        call <span class='y1'>y</span>.

      </p>
      <p>
        You can adjust these values in the equations, in the text below, or on the graph itself directly. Hover over a
        red circle to see the exact value.
      </p>

          This is the classic linear function from middle school, and it has one input and one output. You learned that
          m is the slope, but you may not have made the connection to scaling up the identity by some factor. Also, when
          <span class=x1>x</span> is 0, there's no scaling, so b is the y-intercept.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's natural to ask, what happens if we put two of these functions together, side-by-side? The simplest
          approach is to have two outputs – <span class=y1>y<small>1</small></span> and <span
              class=y2>y<small>2</small></span> – depend on a single input, still called <span class=x1>x</span>. We can
          double-down on linear equations, and plot the lines perpendicular to each other to emphasize that they're
          independent. Or, we can think of these outputs as forming a <i>vector</i>, which basically pairs up all the
          operations. Once again, change the numbers by dragging them:k

          The vector equation uses the two fundamental operations of linear algebra: scalar multiplication and vector
          addition. Scalar multiplication (a scalar is just a single number, instead of a vector) multiplies each
          component of the vector by the scalar. Vector addition adds two vectors (of equal length) by component: the
          first component of the new vector is the sum of the first components of the two vectors being added, and so
          on down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
        That's one input with two outputs, known as a <i>parametric equation</i>. What about two inputs with one output?
        This will require a change of perspecitive. We're used to plotting the x-axis horizontally and the y-axis
        vertically. Now that we want to consider two inputs, we have to use the vertical axis for <span
            class="x2">x<small>2</small></span>. The output we encode as the area of circles, either <span
            class=y1>positive</span> or <span class=negative>negative</span>. This type of diagram is known as a
        <i>scalar field</i>.

        <p>
        Bear in mind that this is a sample; the true scalar field is a continuous surface "above" and "below" the plane
        of the screen, tilted flatness interrupted by a V-shaped rift. You might see this rift as a "wave" of whiteness
        moving across the field as you change the additive constant (<span class='third param'></span>). It's tempting
        to see the wave moving perpendicular to itself, but this is an illusion – it's always moving vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vector equation on the right uses the dot product of two vectors to concisely represent the repeated
          multiplication and addition operations on the left. The dot product multiplies each pair of components
          together, and then adds them all up, taking two vectors to a single scalar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can ask, what happens when we have two inputs and two outputs?
        </p>
        <p>
          We use a <i>matrix</i> to compactly store all the parameters. A matrix is really just a description of a
          function; terse, but useful one you know how to think of it. The scale factors go down the main diagonal, top
          left to bottom right. The translations are on the right side. The bottom row is always zero-zero-one.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the remaining numbers where things get interesting: they control the "crosstalk" between the first and
          second function. The first input can influence the second output, and vice versa, a phenomenon known as
          <i>shear</i>. Despite carefully examining all the ingredients in isolation, we couldn't have predicted this
          would happen when we put them together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graphically, a matrix's function is a <i>vector field</i>. Instead of having one number at every point in the
          plane, we now have two. A vector field shows the result vector (but not its components), shrunken down so they
          don't overlap when repeated. This allows us to see patterns of swirls, attraction, and repulsion. Each arrow
          is a weather vane, and the matrix controls the wind.

          The pencil-and-paper notation puts the input vector right of the matrix, but it's shown above it here. This
          emphasizes how matrices work: to compute the output vector, multiply each column of the matrix by the input
          above it, and then add up the columns (think of squishing them together horizontally).
        </p>
        <p>
          It's worth noting that a vector field is not the only way to think about this function; two overlapping scalar
          fields would also work. Nicky Case has <a href=http://ncase.me/matrix/>a demo</a> where the two dimensions of
          input double up to also show the two dimensions of output. You can see where a point starts and where it ends
          relative to the same pair of axes, the vector showing the change in position. (You can think of the vectors in
          my vector field as showing the force on a particle at a point.) All of these are valid tradeoffs, given the
          inherently tricky problem of trying to depict four dimensional functions using only a 2D plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          In pure mathematics, you'll typically only see the top-left two-by-two of our three-by-three matrix. The right
          column allows us to add constants (one in each output dimension) in addition to what we get by multiplying
          the inputs. However, in computer graphics we want to distinguish between <i>points</i>, which can be scaled
          and translated, and <i>vectors</i>, which can only be scaled. Click the <span class=point>orange</span> 1 to
          make it a 0, which turns the input from a point to a vector. Notice that the output is also now a vector,
          since its last component is now zero. This means we can use the same matrix on points and vectors, which is
          particularly handy if the matrix took a long time to compute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same trick works in 3D as well.

          A 3D vector field might look like a forest of blue arrows, but it's visualizing a function from 3 input to
          three outputs, squeezing six dimensions onto your screen's two. It's actually easier to see when you adjust
          the matrix and see how the arrows change – predictably, in lines and at right angles. There is symmetry in the
          motion, each left counterbalanced by a right wherever the sign is flipped. By modifying the matrix, you're
          getting a glimpse into the space of all possible matrices, a <i>twelve</i> dimensional space. Do we need
          fifteen inputs to specify three outputs? Not for a single function, no, but breaking things apart allows us to
          see adjacent functions in many dimensions. If something isn't right, e have a lot of knobs to fix it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps more importantly, you should have some idea of what each of those knobs <i>do</i> thanks to the
          presentation. Color, notation, and interactivity have been chosen very carefully to give a consistent design.
          More importantly, each stage incrementally built on <span class=y1>y</span> = m<span class=x1>x</span> + b.
          There, we saw that looking at zero showed us the addition only, and that's true even in the 3D vector field,
          for the very simple reason that scaling zero by anything is always zero. We've added more numbers, and seen
          the surprising effect of shear between them, but the fundamental concepts have stayed the same. Addition and
          multiplication, translation and scaling, served as guideposts as we hoisted ourselves ever higher.
