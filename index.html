        A linear function for an input (called <span class='x1'>x</span>) <i>scales</i> x by multiplying it by a scale
        factor called m. Then it <i>translates</i> the result by adding another value, called b. The output we call
        <span class='y1'>y</span>.

        You can adjust these values in the equations, in the text below, or on the graph itself directly. Hover over a
        red circle to see the exact value.

          This is the classic linear function from middle school, and it has one input and one output. It's natural to
          ask, what happens if we put two of these functions together? The simplest approach is to have two outputs
          depend on a single input. It's convenient to think of these outputs as forming a <i>vector</i>.
