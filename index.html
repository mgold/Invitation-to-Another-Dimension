      <h1>Invitation to Another Dimension</h1>
      <h2>from Max Goldstein</h2>
      <p>
        So much of math seems to be unrelated bits and pieces. Learn this for the test, then forget it to make room for
        the next thing. But this is an illusion fostered by the frequently atrocious high school curriculum. Mathematics
        has structure, ideas that start simple and then are extended and combined. Here, we're looking at two of them:

        <ul>
            <li>Functions transform inputs into outputs. You can group similar functions by how many inputs and outputs
            they take. For our purposes, each input or output is just a number. We'll call the inputs <span
                class='x1'>x</span> and the outputs <span class='y1'>y</span>, adding subscript numbers once we get more
            than one. Each input or output is called a <i>dimension</i>.
            </li>

            <li>We're looking at functions that use addition and multiplication only to turn inputs into outputs. We'll
            see that geometrically, addition is <i>translation</i> and multiplication is <i>scaling</i>. We'll leave the
            polynomials, exponentials, and sine waves for another day.
            </li>
        </ul>

        A linear function for an input, called <span class='x1'>x</span>, will scale the input by multiplying it by a
        scale factor called m. Then it translates the result by adding another value, called b. The output we
        call <span class='y1'>y</span>.

      </p>
      <p>
        You can adjust these values in the equations, in the text below, or on the graph itself directly. Hover over a
        red circle to see the exact value.

          This is the classic linear function from middle school, and it has one input and one output. It's natural to
          ask, what happens if we put two of these functions together? The simplest approach is to have two outputs –
          <span class=y1>y<small>1</small></span> and <span class=y2>y<small>2</small></span> – depend on a single
          input, still called <span class=x1>x</span>. We can double-down on equations, or we can think of these outputs
          as forming a <i>vector</i>.

          The vector equation uses the two fundamental operations of linear algebra: scalar multiplication and vector
          addition. Scalar multiplication (a scalar is just a single number, instead of a vector) multiplies each
          component of the vector by the scalar. Vector addition adds two vectors (of equal length) by component: the
          first component of the new vector is the sum of the first components of the two vectors being added, and so
          on down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're used to plotting the x-axis horizontally and the y-axis vertically. Now that we want to consider two
          inputs, we have to use the vertical axis for <span class="x2">x<small>2</small></span>. The output we encode
          as the area of circles, either <span class=y1>positive</span> or <span class=negative>negative</span>. This
          type of diagram is known as a <i>scalar field</i>.

        Bear in mind that this is a sample; the true scalar field is a continuous surface "above" and "below" the plane
        of the screen, tilted flatness interrupted by a V-shaped rift. You might see this rift as a "wave" of whiteness
        moving across the field as you change the additive constant (<span class='third param'></span>). It's tempting
        to see the wave moving perpendicular to itself, but this is an illusion – it's always moving vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vector equation on the right uses the dot product of two vectors to concisely represent the repeated
          multiplication and addition operations on the left. The dot product multiplies each pair of components
          together, and then adds them all up, taking two vectors to a single scalar.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now we can ask, what happens when we have two inputs and two outputs? 
        </p>
        <p>
          We use a <i>matrix</i> to compactly store all the parameters. A matrix is really just a description of a
          function; terse, but useful one you know how to think of it. The scale factors go down the main diagonal, top
          left to bottom right. The translations are on the right side. The bottom row is always zero-zero-one.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the remaining numbers where things get interesting: they control the "crosstalk" between the first and
          second function. The first input can influence the second output, and vice versa. Despite carefully examining
          all the ingredients in isolation, we couldn't have predicted this would happen when we put them together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graphically, a matrix's function is a <i>vector field</i>. Instead of having one number at every point in the
          plane, we now have two. A vector field shows the result vector (but not its components), shrunken down so they
          don't overlap when repeated. This allows us to see patterns of swirls, attraction, and repulsion. Each arrow
          is a weather vane, and the matrix controls the wind.

          The pencil-and-paper notation puts the input vector right of the matrix, but it's shown above it here. This
          emphasizes how matrices work: to compute the output vector, multiply each column of the matrix by the input
          above it, and then add up the columns (think of squishing them together horizontally).
        </p>
        <p>
          It's worth noting that a vector field is not the only way to think about this function; two overlapping scalar
          fields would also work. Nicky Case has <a href=http://ncase.me/matrix/>a demo</a> where the two dimensions of
          input double up to also show the two dimensions of output. You can see where a point starts and where it ends
          relative to the same pair of axes. All of these are valid tradeoffs, given the inherently tricky problem of
          trying to depict four dimensional functions using only a 2D plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          In pure mathematics, you'll typically only see the top-left two-by-two of our three-by-three matrix. The right
          column allows us to add a constant (one in each output dimension) in addition to what we get by multiplying
          the inputs. However, in computer graphics we want to distinguish between <i>points</i>, which can be scaled
          and translated, and <i>vectors</i>, which can only be scaled. Click the <span class=point>orange</span> 1 to
          make it a 0, which turns the input from a point to a vector. Notice that the output is also now a vector,
          since its last component is now zero. This means we can use the same matrix on points and vectors, which is
          particularly handy if the matrix took a long time to compute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same trick works in 3D as well.
